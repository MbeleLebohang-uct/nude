## Nude Insurance | Showcase Project

This is the Nude insurance product built using [Root](https://root.co.za) platform.

The project showcases how you can use Root's to build an end-to-end insurance product. We make use Root's webhooks
to handle events on policies, policyholders and claims. We showcase some example userflows that you can implement in
your application using Root.

Nude insurance is a mock insurance, not a real product.
